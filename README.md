## Data-Structures-concordance
Final Project in Data Structures Course<br/>
Concordance is an alphabetical index of the principal words in a book, we asked to Create a Data Structure that can can be able to 
make a corcordance in efficent way by Time complexity and place.
I managed to make it with implementation of simple Structures such as Binary search tree, lists and get it in avearage time complexity
in search/deletion a single Word - O(log(n/26))

here is an operation of the algorithm with a given text:
